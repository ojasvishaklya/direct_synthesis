# direct_synthesis
PID tuning using model based direct synthesis method

Consider a first-order process with a desired closed-loop response that is second
order. Use the direct synthesis procedure with the following specified closed-loop
transfer function (which is critically damped),

          1
q(s) = --------
        (λs+1)^2

to derive the controller. Perform simulations for several values of λ and plot the
closed loop response and corresponding control signal variations.
