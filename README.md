# direct_synthesis
PID tuning using model based direct synthesis method

Consider a first-order process with a desired closed-loop response that is second
order. Use the direct synthesis procedure with the following specified closed-loop
transfer function (which is critically damped),

![\Large x=\frac{-b\pm\sqrt{b^2-4ac}}{2a}]


to derive the controller. Perform simulations for several values of λ and plot the
closed loop response and corresponding control signal variations.
